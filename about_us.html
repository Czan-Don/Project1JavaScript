        <p>Experience the entire world of wildlife at one of our PAWS-Compliant locations. Travel through jungles,
            deserts, and even the wilds of Canada itself to meet some of the Earth’s most elusive and mysterious
            residents! Facilities are a self-guided experience, open year-round, except for Christmas Day! You’ll find
            over 250 animals on display throughout the zoo. Although reptiles are our specialty, watch out for colorful
            amphibians, and fluffy arachnids as well!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Engage with our passionate Cast Members as they perform their reptile care duties! Throughout the day you can
            watch them maintain the exhibits, clean the venomous snakes in the Venomous Workshop, prepare food in our
            Creature Kitchen and interact with them throughout the zoo.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Throughout the day get to know our animals even better by attending one of our six scheduled shows or tours
            and four scheduled feedings! No need for fear! Our animals are securely contained in escape-proof exhibits,
            for their health and happiness as well as yours! Our animal ambassadors are safe to meet under the
            supervision of our expert Cast Members, and no Guest is forced to interact with animals if they are
            unsure!</p>

        <b><p>Where do our Flourish come from?</p></b><br>
        <p>Every city has a dog and cat shelter, but there are few options for reptiles in need of new homes! Flourish is
            committed to helping private owners and government organizations find suitable lifelong homes for these
            animals, which cannot be released to the wild.</p>
        <p>Our Flourish family consists of dedicated caretakers, passionate educators, and reptile enthusiasts who work
            together to provide a safe and loving environment for our animal residents.</p>
